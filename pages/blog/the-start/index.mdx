## My Headline

It’s almost parody how common it is for designers to frequently and publicly redesign their website. Ethan Marcotte and Frank Chimero are two such people who quite publicly went through their own flavours of dismantling and patiently reassembling their websites, and here I am experiencing my own Popeye moment and reflecting on the longevity of the former lives of my website’s design.

The current design (as of April 29, 2021) has been practically unchanged—structurally speaking, at least—since July 2019, which is a pretty long time! Prior to this iteration, the design changed fairly substantially every 2–3 months.
